// Everything the temporal layer produced used to be BINARY: a candidate either
// survived the kUDwellMs dwell window or it did not, and after admission ranking
// fell back to Cand::clr — INSTANTANEOUS clearance, which knows nothing about the
// future. A cell that stays clear for the whole 800 ms horizon and a cell a wall
// sweeps at 310 ms therefore scored IDENTICALLY, and the solver had no way to
// prefer durable safety or to express "that gap is opening, go there".
//
// This is the term that scores it: (time-to-danger − kUDwellMs) / (horizon −
// kUDwellMs), clamped to [0,1] — 0 for a candidate that survives admission and no
// more, 1 for one nothing reaches anywhere in the horizon. Free, because
// Core::Temporal::TimeToDanger already computes that time on the way to the
// admission answer and used to throw it away.
//
// 0.30 is deliberately SMALLER than kSolveWeaveW and much smaller than the
// positioning terms. Sized so it can:
//   • break a near-tie decisively — its 0..0.30 span is 2 × kSolveReflexHystEps,
//     so "same spot, but it survives 500 ms longer" wins;
//   • out-rank the comfort tiebreak (kSolveClearW × kSolveClearComfort = 0.125),
//     which is the correct precedence: how long a cell stays safe matters more
//     than how much room it has right now;
// and NOT:
//   • overturn the locked annulus (0.30 buys 0.30/kSolveOutRangeW ≈ 0.19 tiles of
//     out-of-range drift before the linear term alone erases it, and the quadratic
//     term erases it far sooner) — a durable-but-boring cell can never win on time;
//   • buy distance (kSolveMoveW = 1.2 per budget) or beat the lateral-sidestep
//     term (kSolvePerpW = 1.2), so "durable" never turns into "run away".
// It also does NOT double-count with kSolveStandBias: the stand only reaches the
// scored set when the HOLD gate already declined it, and it is measured on exactly
// the same basis as every move candidate (walk-then-hold, zero-length walk).
constexpr float kSolveDurableW = 0.30f;   // full reward for staying clear through the whole horizon
// THE OVER-CORRECTION GUARD. Open space is durable by definition, so if the
// gradient could ever out-weigh the threading stance the dodge would start
// treating "retreat off the pattern" as the best-scoring option and refuse to
// enter shot-wall rooms at all — the exact failure kSolveWeaveW was added to
// prevent. Keeping the gradient strictly below it bounds the worst case: a

//     a candidate for the whole 800 ms horizon. Demanding 800 ms of stillness
//     rejects every tile a wall will EVENTUALLY sweep, which is exactly how the
